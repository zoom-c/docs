Setting up your TREZOR device
=============================

The TREZOR works with almost any computer that has a USB port and an internet connection.  To allow |myTrezor| wallet to communicate with the TREZOR you need to install a piece of software called the TREZOR bridge.  If you go to the |myTrezor| website you should see a page with a Download link.  Download the TREZOR bridge and follow the instructions on the screen.

Once you've got the TREZOR bridge installed go to |myTrezor| again.  This time you should see a web page welcoming you and asking for a device label:
