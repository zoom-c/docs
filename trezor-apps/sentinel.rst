What is Sentinel?
-------------------------

`Sentinel <http://samouraiwallet.com/sentinel/index.html>`_ is an Android app which lets you safely watch over your TREZOR transactions.
Scan any of your account publics key (XPUB) and Sentinel will keep a close watch, alerting you of any new incoming transactions.
It also allows you to generate new receive addresses, so you can receive bitcoin payments directly into selected TREZOR account.
Sentinel cannot create transactions or send your bitcoins, it is only useful as a **watch only wallet**.
