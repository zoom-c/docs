  Title:   Registered coin types for BIP-0044
  Type:    Standard

Abstract
--------

BIP-0044 defines a logical hierarchy for deterministic wallets.
Level 2 of the hierarchy describes a coin type in use.

Motivation
----------

BIP repository does not want to deal with assigning the values for various
coin types different than Bitcoin so we propose this SLIP to become such body.

Registered coin types
---------------------

These are the registered coin types for usage in level 2 of BIP44 described in chapter "Coin type".

All these constants are used as hardened derivation.

===== ========== ================================
index hexa       coin
===== ========== ================================
0     0x80000000 Bitcoin
1     0x80000001 Bitcoin Testnet
2     0x80000002 Litecoin
3     0x80000003 Dogecoin
===== ========== ================================

Coin types will be added only if there is a wallet implementing BIP-0044 for desired coin.
