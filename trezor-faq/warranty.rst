Product doesn't work
====================

How do I test if it works properly?
-----------------------------------

The best way how to test TREZOR is trying to enter bootloader mode. You can do that following these instructions:

1. Open `mytrezor.com <http://www.mytrezor.com>`_ in your browser
2. Hold both buttons when plugging the cable in
3. Release both buttons when cable is plugged in

Now you should see bootloader screen if both buttons work properly. For more information about how to enter the bootloader mode please check this `article <../trezor-user/updatingfirmware.html>`_


It doesn't work, how do I send it back?
---------------------------------------

Basically only thing you need to do is to contact support via `info@buyTREZOR.com <mailto:info@buytrezor.com>`_ to initiate the RMA process. You will receive all the required information by email. We will do our best to troubleshoot the problem with you and you need to ship the product back to us for inspection if we didn't find any solution.


How long will the RMA process take?
-----------------------------------

We inspect all returned items when they arrive at our processing facility. It can take anything between 3 and 40 days since the product is delivered to us.


What can be a result?
---------------------

It depends when exactly you have initiated the RMA process and on the product's condition. There are two basic statuses based on the time period between the product delivery to you and your initiation of the RMA process:

**Defective On Arrival (DOA)**

You can get the most positive outcome if you test the device immediately upon it's delivery to you and report it's malfunction within **15 days since the delivery**. In such case we will consider your request as "Defective On Arrival". When it arrives back to us, we will inspect the product.

Possible outcomes:

1. If we find the product working without any problem, we will ship the original product back to you.
2. If we find the product faulty, we will ship the replacement to you without any delay.

**non Defective On Arrival (non DOA)**

In case you initiate the RMA later than in first 15 days, we consider your request as "non Defective On Arrival". When it arrives back to us, we will inspect the product.

Possible outcomes:

1. If we find the product working without any problem, we will ship the original product back to you.
2. If we find the product faulty, we will forward it to the manufacturer for further detailed inspection using laboratory equipment. This procedure takes about one month due to processing time of the manufacturer. 

It will lead to one of the following situations:

A. Manufacturer rejects the request due to damage was caused by customer and we will ship the original product back to you. 
B. Manufacturer approves the product is faulty and we will ship the replacement to you without any delay.
